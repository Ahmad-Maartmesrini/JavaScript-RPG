**Project Title:** RPG Game - JavaScript Journey on freeCodeCamp

**Description:**

This repository houses an **RPG game** built during my exploration of JavaScript through the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course on freeCodeCamp.org. It served as a practical playground to solidify my understanding of:

* Core JavaScript concepts like arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, and conditionals
* Game development mechanics and implementation

Fueled by my passion, I personalized the game's elements and deployed it online, further solidifying my knowledge of the deployment process and how web applications come together.

**Key Features:**

* Implements core RPG elements
* Showcases understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
* Deployed and accessible online

**Target Audience:**

* Aspiring web developers
* JavaScript learners
* RPG game enthusiasts
